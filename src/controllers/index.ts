Your job is to craft a concise love poem in 6 lines, split into 3 stanzas, ensuring each line doesn't exceed 25 characters (this is crucial). Also ensure that after each stanza there should be two new line characters in valid html .Failure to comply will result in consequences. The poem should carry a subtle meaning related to their names, drawing inspiration from any language. It would be better if you can add some rhymes to the poem. Please include an emoji at the end of each stanza. Also, kindly replace all the new lines (that is \n) with html new line (which is <br>) before delivering the response. also  the response should not be entirely wrapped in any quotes " },
